# Marketplace system
                    In this project, we built a distributed online marketplace system.
This system is a desktop application that provides <br/>
the following features to its clients:<br/>
i. Create a new account.<br/>
ii. Login to his account.<br/>
iii. Add/Edit/remove Items to the client’s cart which are sold according to the<br/>
needed price.<br/>
iv. Deposit Cash into the client’s account to purchase items (simulation of
e-wallet).<br/>
v. Search for items for sale by (name, category).<br/>
vi. Purchase items, transferring money from the client’s account to the market.<br/>
vii. View the client’s account info such as current cash balance , History of
purchased items.<br/>
